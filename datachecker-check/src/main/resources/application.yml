rules:
  # There are three types of filtering rules: table-level rules, row-level rules, and column-level rules.

  # Table level verification and filtering: filter the current database table by configuring a black and white list.
  # The black and white list configuration is mutually exclusive, that is, the black and white list cannot be configured at the same time.
  # If the black and white list is configured at the same time, only the white list will take effect.
  # black and white list configuration rules must:
  # The configured name must be white or black, otherwise the rule is invalid, and we will automatically filter the invalid rule
  # If the configured TEXT is not a regular expression, the rule is invalid and will be filtered automatically
  # If the configured TEXT is empty, the rule is invalid and will be filtered automatically
  # If the configured TEXT is duplicate, the rule item will automatically filter the duplicates.

  #    text: ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z_]+$
  # Row level filtering is to filter the records that need to be verified in all table by adding rules.
  # Sort the table data in ascending order according to the primary key, and obtain the records to be verified ,
  # query quantity, and offset information configured by the user.
  # If table rule and row rule are configured at the same time, row rule will be adapted based on table rule
  # We configure a row rule: regex: 10,100.
  # If the table name is table_name, the primary key is id, then the current table is filtered at the row level,
  # and the equivalent SQL is select * from table_name order by id asc limit 10 , 100
  # row configuration rules must:
  # If the configured text is not match the regular expression ^\d+(\,\d+), then the rule is invalid and will be filtered automatically
  # If the configured name is not a regular expression, the rule is invalid and will be filtered automatically
  # If the configured name is empty, the rule is invalid and will be filtered automatically
  # If the configured name is duplicate, the rule item will automatically filter the duplicates.

  # Column level filtering is to filter the fields that need to be verified in the current table by adding rules to the table.
  # Column level filtering includes two rules: inclusion rules and exclusive rules.
  # Including rules means that only the configured field list is verified, and exclusive rules means that the configured field list is not verified.
  # Inclusion rules and exclusive rules are mutually exclusive rules.
  # Inclusion rules and exclusive rules cannot be configured in the same table at the same time, otherwise the rule will not take effect.
  # When we verify the table data, we require that the table must contain a primary key.
  # Therefore, if the primary key field is not configured in the inclusion rule, we will automatically add the primary key column to the inclusion rule.
  # In addition, if the primary key field is configured in the exclusion rule, we will automatically delete the primary key column from the exclusion rule
  # Column level filter rule configuration:
  #   name: table_name
  #   text: field1,field2,...field
  #   attribute: include
  # If the configured name is empty, the rule is invalid and will be filtered automatically
  # If the configured name is duplicate, the rule item will automatically filter the duplicates.
  # If the configured attribute cannot include or exclude, the rule is invalid, and we will automatically filter the invalid rule
